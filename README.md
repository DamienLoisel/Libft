# **Libft**

## **Description**

**Libft** is a key project at 42 that involves recreating a custom C standard library, providing a set of commonly used functions in C programming. This project is an excellent exercise to strengthen the understanding of C programming fundamentals, as well as memory management, string manipulation, and pointers.

This library contains functions for string manipulation, memory management, linked list manipulation, and other utility tools to aid in developing future C projects.
